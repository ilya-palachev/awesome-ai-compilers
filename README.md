# My survey of literature on compilers for AI models

This survey is intended to cover research on compilers for AI domain. Some of these compilers are widely known as NPU/TPU compilers.

- AI for software engineering, see [Allamanis survey](https://ml4code.github.io/) and [former src-d survey](https://github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code)

## Existing surveys

- Li et al. [The Deep Learning Compiler: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03794.pdf) (Beihang & Tsinghua Universities. arXiv, 2020)
  > To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that provides a comprehensive survey on the design of DL compiler.
